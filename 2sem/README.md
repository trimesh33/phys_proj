# How to brew ideal coffee
<!-- (2nd semester research) -->

Investigate the dependence of the parameters of the brewed beverage on the initial parameters of the system.

System parameters:
- the particle size distribution (the volume averaged dimension and the fraction of volume in fines)
- the bulk density of the bed
- the coffee particle density
- the yield size
- brew temperature
<!-- - the diffusion constants of species inside particles -->

Total Dissolved Solids - TDS
Dependencies:
- TDS on particle size distribution
- TDS on the bulk density of the bed

So to investigate what amount of brewed coffee can be extracted from a given particles and how the system parameters affects the taste depends on social researches.
(also in this research can be done work with student from MIPT and their tastes in coffee)

Compare results with "Coffee Brewing Control chart" and articles from last decade.
